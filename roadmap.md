# `mesograd` roadmap

## Currently Planned

### Maiden PyPi Release
- [ ] Write `Vector`
- [ ] Write `Matrix`
- [x] Custom activations in `Value`
- [ ] `Value`-only `MLP` optimization via `Vector` and `Matrix`
- [ ] `mypyc` compilation
- [ ] First major release on PyPi

### Second Major Release
- [ ] `Vector`, `Matrix`, and `Value` interop in `Neuron`, `Layer`, and `MLP`
- [ ] Training capabilites added
- [ ] Native graphing/visualization capabilites in the library (not just in a Jupyter notebook like the original)
- [ ] Real examples using `mesograd`
- [ ] Second major release to PyPi

## In Consideration
- More nns (like RNNs, CNNs, Transformers)
- More traning algs/methods
